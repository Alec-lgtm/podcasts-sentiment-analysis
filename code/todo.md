# Todo

- [ ] Make sure that files in the visualization folder run (since I changed the relative file paths)
- [ ] Finish refractoring and cleaning sentiment_visualizations.qmd
- [ ] (for fun) Run our Vox articles through a pre-trained model / ChatGPT using their API

- [ ] Run over the blog and see what else I could do
- [ ] (for fun) add an interactive component to our plots (shiny or plotly)
